      "I'm a full stack developer with 1.6+ years of experience at Accenture and a track record of independently building and deploying complete projects — React on the frontend, and Node.js, REST APIs, and MongoDB on the backend. I've shipped a full MERN-stack SaaS mock interview platform with JWT authentication and live LLM-based grading, alongside an Oracle ETL data warehouse pipeline, a documented SQL performance tuning case study, and an n8n + LLM incident-triage automation.",
      "In my day-to-day role at Accenture, I work on Oracle-based data warehouse systems in a production ETL environment — building PL/SQL packages, tuning SQL performance, and resolving data-load failures within SLA as part of a cross-functional support team. That production discipline around debugging, exception handling, and reliability carries directly into how I build and deploy my own full-stack projects.",
      "I'm a fast learner of new tools and platforms, comfortable taking a project from local development to a live, publicly accessible deployment end-to-end. I'm currently extending my backend experience into Node.js REST APIs and building AI-assisted automation skills using n8n and Claude/LLM integration.",
