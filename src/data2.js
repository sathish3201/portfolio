    "Full stack developer with 1.6+ years of experience at Accenture, building production Oracle PL/SQL systems by day and independently shipping complete full-stack projects on the side — React on the frontend, and Node.js/Express, REST APIs, and MongoDB on the backend. Has built and deployed a full MERN-stack SaaS mock interview platform with JWT authentication and live LLM-based grading (Groq/Llama), a full-stack business marketing site with a working contact form and built-in FAQ chatbot, an e-commerce storefront demo with Razorpay test-mode checkout and server-side payment verification, an Oracle ETL data warehouse pipeline with production-style exception handling, a documented SQL performance tuning case study, and an n8n + LLM incident-triage automation — all version-controlled on GitHub, several with live public deployments on Render. Comfortable with Git-based workflows, debugging, and deployment end-to-end, from local development to publicly accessible URLs. Currently extending backend experience into Node.js REST APIs and AI-assisted workflow automation (n8n, Claude/LLM integration). Java Full Stack Certified (Wipro TalentNext); eager to learn, curious, and looking to grow with a collaborative team.",
